* Keybinding Configuration

This configuration uses [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][evil-mode]] for a Vi-like modal editing experience.  [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used for easy keybinding configuration that integrates well with which-key.  [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is used to automatically configure various Emacs modes with Vi-like keybindings for evil-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make ESC quit prompts

* UI Configuration

** Command Log Mode

[[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode][command-log-mode]] is useful for displaying a panel showing each key binding you use in a panel on the right side of the frame.  Great for live streams and screencasts!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package command-log-mode)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package doom-themes
  :init (load-theme 'doom-gruvbox t))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package doom-modeline
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom ((doom-modeline-height 15)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (use-package ivy
      :diminish
      :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
             :map ivy-minibuffer-map
             ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-l" . ivy-done)
             ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
             :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
      :config
      (ivy-mode 1))

    (use-package ivy-rich
      :init
      (ivy-rich-mode 1))

    (use-package counsel
      :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
             :map minibuffer-local-map
             ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
      :config
      (counsel-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Text Scaling

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s t s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hydra)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))

  (rune/leader-keys
    "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (org-babel-do-load-languages

** Languages

*** IDE Features with lsp-mode

**** lsp-mode

We use the excellent [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] to enable IDE-like functionality for many different programming languages via "language servers" that speak the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]].  Before trying to set up =lsp-mode= for a particular language, check out the [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/][documentation for your language]] so that you can learn which language servers are available and how to install them.

The =lsp-keymap-prefix= setting enables you to define a prefix for where =lsp-mode='s default keybindings will be added.  I *highly recommend* using the prefix to find out what you can do with =lsp-mode= in a buffer.

The =which-key= integration adds helpful descriptions of the various keys so you should be able to learn a lot just by pressing =C-c l= in a =lsp-mode= buffer and trying different things that you find there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Increase for better lsp-mode performance; see
  ;; https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000)
  (when (boundp 'read-process-output-max)
    ;; New in Emacs 27
    (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)))

  (defun bonk/lsp-mode-setup ()
    (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-segments '(path-up-to-project file symbols))
    (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-mode))

  (use-package lsp-mode
    :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
    :hook (lsp-mode . bonk/lsp-mode-setup)
    :init
    (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l")  ;; Or 'C-l', 's-l'
    :config
    (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)
    :custom
    (lsp-file-watch-threshold nil)
    (lsp-solargraph-multi-root nil))

#+end_src

**** lsp-ui

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-ui/][lsp-ui]] is a set of UI enhancements built on top of =lsp-mode= which make Emacs feel even more like an IDE.  Check out the screenshots on the =lsp-ui= homepage (linked at the beginning of this paragraph) to see examples of what it can do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ui
    :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)
    :custom
    (lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom))

#+end_src

**** lsp-treemacs

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]] provides nice tree views for different aspects of your code like symbols in a file, references of a symbol, or diagnostic messages (errors and warnings) that are found in your code.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-treemacs-symbols= - Show a tree view of the symbols in the current file
- =lsp-treemacs-references= - Show a tree view for the references of the symbol under the cursor
- =lsp-treemacs-error-list= - Show a tree view for the diagnostic messages in the project

This package is built on the [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]] package which might be of some interest to you if you like to have a file browser at the left side of your screen in your editor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-treemacs
    :after lsp)

#+end_src

**** lsp-ivy

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] integrates Ivy with =lsp-mode= to make it easy to search for things by name in your code.  When you run these commands, a prompt will appear in the minibuffer allowing you to type part of the name of a symbol in your code.  Results will be populated in the minibuffer so that you can find what you're looking for and jump to that location in the code upon selecting the result.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in the current project workspace
- =lsp-ivy-global-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in all active project workspaces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ivy)

#+end_src

*** TypeScript

This is a basic configuration for the TypeScript language so that =.ts= files activate =typescript-mode= when opened.  We're also adding a hook to =typescript-mode-hook= to call =lsp-deferred= so that we activate =lsp-mode= to get LSP features every time we edit TypeScript code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package typescript-mode
    :mode "\\.ts\\'"
    :hook (typescript-mode . lsp-deferred)
    :config
    (setq typescript-indent-level 2))

#+end_src

*Important note!*  For =lsp-mode= to work with TypeScript (and JavaScript) you will need to install a language server on your machine.  If you have Node.js installed, the easiest way to do that is by running the following command:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no

npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript

#+end_src

This will install the [[https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]] and the TypeScript compiler package.

*** Ruby
**** inf-ruby
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (use-package inf-ruby)
     #+end_src
     
**** ruby-mode
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp

	 :ensure nil
	 :after lsp-mode
	 :hook ((ruby-mode . lsp-deferred)

     #+end_src

**** robe-mode
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (use-package robe)

     #+end_src

**** Flymake
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (require 'flymake-ruby)
       (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'flymake-ruby-load)
     #+end_src
     
** Company Mode

[[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company Mode]] provides a nicer in-buffer completion interface than =completion-at-point= which is more reminiscent of what you would expect from an IDE.  We add a simple configuration to make the keybindings a little more useful (=TAB= now completes the selection and initiates completion at the current location if needed).

We also use [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box][company-box]] to further enhance the look of the completions with icons and better overall presentation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package company
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
    :bind (:map company-active-map
		("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
    (:map lsp-mode-map
	  ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
    :custom
    (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
    (company-idle-delay 0.0))

  (global-company-mode t)
  (push 'company-robe company-backends)

#+end_src

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config (projectile-mode)
    :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
    :init
    ;; NOTE: Set this to the folder where you keep your Git repos!
    (when (file-directory-p "~/github")
      (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/github")))

  ;; (use-package forge)

#+end_src

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.
